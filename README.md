# Recurrent_Neural_Network
A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior.

This code creates and trains Recurrent Neural Networks (layrecnet), using different values of the hyper-parameters (model selection on validation set is included in the code also) for next step prediction of a given sequence.
